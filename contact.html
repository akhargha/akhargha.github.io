                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I am currently a sophomore at <a href="https://www.trincoll.edu"><u>Trinity College</u></a> in Hartford, CT. 
                    I am originally from Arunachal Pradesh, India. 
                    I am working towards a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science with a minor in Applied Math.
                    I have been interested in Design and Math since middle school and took up coding in High School. 
                    I am passionate about Music. I play the piano and the guitar, and produce music digitally. </p>
                    <br>
                <h3 style="color: #658864;"><i>What am I doing right now?</i></h3>
                <p>
                    Currently, I am working as a Research Assistant at Prof. Ewa Syta and Prof. Amir Herzberg's lab 
                    at <a href="https://www.trincoll.edu"><u>Trinity College</u></a> & <a href="https://uconn.edu"><u>University of Connecticut</u></a> 
                    on <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2149766&HistoricalAwards=false"><u>Applied Cryptographic Protocols for Provably Secure Foundations.</u></a>
                    This semester, I am taking classes on Software Design, Intro to Computer Systems, Math Foundations of CS and Film Making. I also work as the IT Desk Student Consultant 
                    and the Residential Advisor of Summit East at Trinity College. I am also in the process of designing a <a href="https://github.com/akhargha/trincoll_scheduler"><u>college course scheduler</u></a>- a long term personal project. My future 
                    plans with this project include implementing user-authentication via Flask and crafting API endpoints.
